# Production Cache Clearing Guide

## Issue
The production version is not showing the latest die positioning fixes for Sauce and Drink pages.

## Root Cause
This is likely a **caching issue** - either browser cache or Vercel's build cache.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache (Try This First!)

#### Chrome/Edge:
1. Open your production site
2. Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)
3. This does a "hard refresh" bypassing cache

#### Alternative - Clear Cache Completely:
1. Open DevTools (`Cmd + Option + I` on Mac)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

#### Safari:
1. Press `Cmd + Option + E` to empty caches
2. Then `Cmd + R` to reload

---

### Step 2: Verify Vercel Deployment

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your FoodToday project
3. Check the "Deployments" tab
4. Verify that the latest commit is deployed:
   - Look for commit: `853a322 Fix: Email confirmation bug and hide social authentication`
   - Status should be "Ready"
   - Deployment should be from the `main` branch

---

### Step 3: Force Vercel Redeploy (If Needed)

If the latest commit isn't deployed or cache persists:

#### Option A: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Your project
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click the "..." menu (three dots)
4. Select "Redeploy"
5. Choose "Use existing Build Cache: NO" (important!)

#### Option B: Trigger New Deployment
Make a small change and push:
```bash
# Make a small change to force rebuild
echo "# Production build $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Force production rebuild"
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 4: Verify the Fix Works

Once cache is cleared or redeployed, test:

#### Drink Page:
1. Click on a drink card in the carousel ‚Üí Should show recipe popup (die stays in place)
2. Click on a drink button ‚Üí Should show recipe popup (die stays in place)
3. Click the die (üé≤) ‚Üí Die should move to a random drink and highlight it

#### Sauce Page:
1. Click on a sauce button ‚Üí Should show recipe popup (die stays in place)
2. Click the die (üé≤) ‚Üí Die should move to a random sauce and highlight it

---

## What Should Happen (Expected Behavior)

### ‚úÖ Correct Behavior:
- **Manual Selection** (clicking card/button): Opens recipe popup, die doesn't move
- **Die Roll** (clicking üé≤): Die moves to random choice and highlights it
- **Hover on Die**: Resets die position back to corner

### ‚ùå Old Buggy Behavior (should be fixed):
- Clicking card/button moves the die (WRONG - should only show recipe)
- Die disappears after moving
- Die moves to wrong position

---

## Current Code Status

‚úÖ **Local Code**: Has all fixes
‚úÖ **Git Repository**: All commits pushed to `origin/main`
‚úÖ **Vercel**: Should have latest code (check deployment status)

**Latest Commits:**
- `853a322` - Email confirmation fix + hide social auth
- `2e67d58` - Die positioning documentation
- `6eaaf70` - Complete die positioning fixes
- `80211d8` - Sauce page die stability
- `6230465` - Safety checks for die

---

## Still Not Working?

If after clearing cache and verifying deployment it still doesn't work:

1. **Check Console Errors**:
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Console tab
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Share any errors you see

2. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
   - Reload page
   - Look for the main JavaScript file (e.g., `index-CUFKaqR8.js`)
   - Check the file size - should be ~1.14 MB
   - If it's different, cache might still be an issue

3. **Try Incognito/Private Window**:
   - Open production site in incognito mode
   - This bypasses all cache
   - If it works here, it's definitely a cache issue

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Hard refresh browser (`Cmd + Shift + R`)
- [ ] Check Vercel deployment status
- [ ] Verify latest commit is deployed
- [ ] Test Drink page die behavior
- [ ] Test Sauce page die behavior
- [ ] Try incognito mode if still not working
- [ ] Consider forcing Vercel redeploy without cache
