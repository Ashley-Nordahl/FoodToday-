# Parties Page Ingredients - Added to Registry

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## 🎯 Issue Found

The Parties page (`src/pages/Parties.jsx`) was using ingredient IDs that were **not** in the centralized ingredient registry, causing potential translation mismatches.

### Ingredients Found in Parties.jsx

Located around lines 2200-2450, the Parties page had hardcoded ingredient data for party planning features:

```javascript
// Around line 2210-2453
const ingredientData = {
  meat: { /* pork, beef, chicken */ },
  seafood: { /* fish, shellfish */ },
  vegetables: { /* general, mushrooms */ },
  grains: { /* whole grains, refined grains */ },
  eggs: { /* chicken eggs */ }
}
```

---

## ❌ Missing Ingredients Identified

These ingredient IDs were used in Parties.jsx but **NOT** in the registry:

| Ingredient ID | Used In | Issue |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| `beef-roast` | Beef subcategory | Not in registry |
| `brown-rice` | Whole Grains subcategory | Only had `rice` and `white-rice` |
| `button-mushrooms` | Mushrooms subcategory | Registry had `button-mushroom` (singular) |
| `carrots` | General Vegetables | Registry had `carrot` (singular) |
| `bell-peppers` | General Vegetables | Registry had `bell-pepper` (singular) |
| `chicken-eggs` | Eggs category | Registry had specific egg types but not general "chicken-eggs" |

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Added to Registry (`src/data/ingredientRegistry.js`)

```javascript
// Beef - Added beef-roast
'beef-roast': { category: 'Meat', subcategory: 'Beef' },

// Grains - Added brown-rice
'brown-rice': { category: 'Grains', subcategory: 'Whole Grains' },

// Vegetables - Added plural forms
'button-mushrooms': { category: 'Vegetables', subcategory: 'Mushrooms' },
'carrots': { category: 'Vegetables', subcategory: 'General' },
'bell-peppers': { category: 'Vegetables', subcategory: 'General' },

// Eggs - Added general chicken-eggs
'chicken-eggs': { category: 'Egg', subcategory: 'Chicken Eggs' },
```

## 🔒 Why Plural Forms?

**Question:** Why add both `carrot` and `carrots`?

**Answer:** Different UI contexts require different forms:

```javascript
// Singular - used in recipes
"Add 1 carrot, diced"

// Plural - used in selection lists
"Select ingredients: Carrots ✓"
```

Both forms are valid and used in different places:
- **Recipes:** Usually singular ("1 carrot")
- **Selection UI:** Usually plural ("Carrots" as a category)
- **Parties.jsx:** Uses plural forms in selection interface

Having both prevents mismatches and provides flexibility.

## 🎯 Affected Pages

### ✅ Now Works Correctly

1. **Parties Page (`src/pages/Parties.jsx`)**
   - Lines 2200-2453: Ingredient selection for party planning
   - All 6 missing ingredients now have translations
   - No more translation failures

2. **IngredientSelector (`src/components/IngredientSelector.jsx`)**
   - Can support both singular and plural forms
   - Validates all IDs against registry

3. **Future Components**
   - Any component using these ingredients will have translations ready

## 🔍 How These Were Found

1. **User Report:** "ingredients in sauces page, drink page are missing"
2. **Investigation:** Searched for ingredient IDs in all pages
3. **Discovery:** Found hardcoded ingredients in Parties.jsx (lines 2210-2453)
4. **Validation:** Ran script to identify missing translations
5. **Fix:** Added to registry + translations
6. **Verification:** Validation passed ✅

## 📝 Notes

### Sauce & Drink Pages
The Sauce and Drink pages use **recipe text strings** (like "1/2 cup soy sauce"), not ingredient IDs, so they don't need to be in the registry. These are actual recipe instructions, not selectable ingredients.

Example:
```javascript
// Sauce.jsx - Recipe text (NOT ingredient IDs)
ingredients: [
  '1/2 cup soy sauce',
  '1/4 cup mirin',
  '2 cloves garlic, minced'
]

// Parties.jsx - Ingredient IDs (NEEDS registry)
items: [
  { id: 'pork-belly', name: 'Pork Belly' },
  { id: 'beef-roast', name: 'Beef Roast' }  // ← This needed to be added
]
```

### Parties Page Structure
The Parties page has TWO sections that use ingredient IDs:
1. **generateSingleDish** (lines ~2200-2300)
2. **generateDoubleDish** (lines ~2350-2450)

Both sections were updated to use the registry ingredients.
