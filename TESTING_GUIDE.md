# Testing Image Display

## Quick Test Steps

1. **Open your app** at http://localhost:5173
2. **Open browser console** (Press F12)
3. **Select a random recipe**
4. **Look for these console messages**:
   - "Fetching image from Foodish API..."
   - "Foodish API response: {image: '...'}"
   - Or error messages if something fails

## What to Check

### In Browser Console:
- [ ] Do you see "Fetching image from Foodish API..."?
- [ ] Do you see "Foodish API response: {image: '...'}"?
- [ ] Any error messages?

### Visual Check:
- [ ] Do you see a loading spinner with "Generating image..."?
- [ ] Does an image appear after loading?
- [ ] Is the image blank or broken?

## Expected Behavior

1. **Loading State**: You should see a spinner with üçΩÔ∏è emoji
2. **Image Appears**: Random food image from Foodish API
3. **If Error**: Image container is hidden

## Troubleshooting

### No Image Appears
Check console for:
- Network errors
- CORS errors
- API timeout

### Image is Broken
- The Foodish API might be down
- Fallback should kick in
- Check if fallback URL loads

### Console Shows Errors
Share the error messages for debugging
