# Image Implementation Status

## Current Status
✅ Image generation code is implemented
✅ Image styles are added to CSS
✅ Import statements added to DishToday.jsx
✅ Dev server is running on http://localhost:5173

## Current Image Source
Using **Picsum Photos** - free placeholder images
- Reliable and fast
- Random images per dish
- No API key needed

## What to Check

1. Open browser console (F12) and select a random recipe
2. Look for console logs showing:
   - "Image loaded successfully: [URL]" or
   - "Image failed to load: [URL]"

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Unsplash Rate Limiting
If you see "Image failed to load", Unsplash might be rate-limiting. Try:
- Refresh the page
- Wait a minute and try again
- Check if image URL is accessible in browser directly

### Issue 2: CORS Issues
If you see CORS errors in console:
- Unsplash is blocking the request
- May need to use a different image service

### Issue 3: Image Hidden
If the image loads but you don't see it:
- Check if CSS is applying correctly
- Check browser DevTools Elements panel
- Verify image container has correct height

## Testing Steps

1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Log in
3. Select "Random" tab
4. Click to get a random recipe
5. Check console for image URL
6. Look for the image at the top of the recipe card

## Next Steps

If images don't appear:
1. Try a different image source (e.g., Foodish API)
2. Add placeholder images for testing
3. Use emoji fallback as primary display
