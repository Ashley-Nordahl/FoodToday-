# 🚀 Force Production Redeploy Instructions

## ✅ What I've Done

I've created a new commit that will force Vercel to rebuild your app with all the latest die positioning fixes:

**Commit:** `49f3409 - Force production redeploy - Die positioning fixes for Sauce and Drink pages`

This commit includes:
- Updated README with timestamp
- All previous die positioning fixes
- Cache-busting change to trigger fresh build

## 📤 Next Step: Push to GitHub

You need to push this commit to trigger the Vercel deployment.

### Run This Command:

```bash
git push origin main
```

If you're prompted for credentials:
- **Username:** Your GitHub username
- **Password:** Your GitHub Personal Access Token (not your password!)

### Don't Have a Personal Access Token?

If git asks for password and it doesn't work:

1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "FoodToday Deploy"
4. Select scope: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

### Alternative: Use GitHub Desktop

If you have GitHub Desktop installed:
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. It should show the new commit
3. Click "Push origin"
4. Done!

## ⏱️ After Pushing

1. **Vercel will automatically deploy** (1-2 minutes)
2. **Check deployment status:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Find your FoodToday project
   - Watch the deployment progress

3. **Once deployed, test:**
   - Open your production site
   - Do a hard refresh: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
   - Test the die behavior on Drink and Sauce pages

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Deployment

### Drink Page:
- ✅ Click carousel card → Recipe popup opens (die doesn't move)
- ✅ Click drink button → Recipe popup opens (die doesn't move)
- ✅ Click die 🎲 → Die moves to random drink + highlights it

### Sauce Page:
- ✅ Click sauce button → Recipe popup opens (die doesn't move)
- ✅ Click die 🎲 → Die moves to random sauce + highlights it

## 🐛 If It Still Doesn't Work

After pushing and Vercel deploys:

### 1. Force Vercel to Rebuild Without Cache
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Click on the latest deployment
   - Click "..." menu → "Redeploy"
   - **IMPORTANT:** Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"
   - Click "Redeploy"

### 2. Check for Errors
   - Open production site
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Check Console tab for errors
   - Check Network tab to verify new files are loading

### 3. Verify Build Output
   - In Vercel deployment logs, look for:
     ```
     dist/assets/index-[hash].js
     ```
   - The hash should be different from previous deployment
   - File size should be ~1.14 MB

## 📝 Summary of All Fixes Included

This deployment includes ALL of these fixes:

1. ✅ **Die positioning logic** - Die moves accurately to selections
2. ✅ **Manual selection behavior** - Clicking cards/buttons shows recipe only
3. ✅ **Die roll behavior** - Die moves and highlights random selection
4. ✅ **Hover reset** - Hovering die resets position
5. ✅ **Email confirmation fix** - Session refresh on login
6. ✅ **Clean auth UI** - Social buttons hidden
